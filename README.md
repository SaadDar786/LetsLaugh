# LetsLaugh
Lets Laugh (Android - Java)

I have tried to demonstrate the implementation of HTTP client (RetroFit), mapping of JSON response to java classes using GJSON, RecyclerView to show the jokes on the screen and SwipeRefreshLayout which refreshes the screen with new jokes. 

To all the peeps out there, give it a try and enjoy hilarious jokes. Any contribution or feedback is welcome and highly appreciated.
# Controls
 1. RecyclerView
 2. SwipeRefreshLayout (Pull to refresh the Jokes on the screen)
 
# FrameWorks
 1. RetroFit
 2. GJSON

# Dependancy Management
 1. Gradle

# Design Pattern
 1. MVC
 2. Interfaces for communication between Service & UI
 3. Facade
 
# JSON (Sample)
{
  "type": "success",
  "value": [
    {
      "id": 555,
      "joke": "Chuck Norris doesn't have pubic hairs because hair doesn't grow on balls of steal.",
      "categories": [
        "explicit"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 517,
      "joke": "Chuck Norris solved the halting problem.",
      "categories": [
        "nerdy"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# Improvements/Updates
 1. Refine UI & UX.
 2. Implementing the details screen for every Joke.
 3. Share a joke with friends via Facebook/Linkedin/Whatsapp/Twitter
